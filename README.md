ðŸ‘‰Game Logic
The game comprises a grid where the user controls a snake and moves around the map
There will be items scattered across the map which the snake can eat
The snake must eat the items in the correct sequence
The snake dies when it hits a wall or eats itself.
Here is a demo to give an idea on how the game works.

ðŸ‘‰NormalMode
âœ”Display a grid of dimensions at least 20 x 20
âœ”The size of the snake is three tiles long
âœ”The Snake travels across the map to eat color blocks. The color blocks must be eaten in the correct sequence as displayed.
âœ”Implement a suitable scoring system
âœ”Implement a time system: the game continues as long as there is time on the clock. When completing a sequence of blocks, the player gains time.
âœ”Make the game mobile responsive
âœ”Implement onscreen direction control to steer the snake
âœ”Implement a leaderboard system using local storage

ðŸ‘‰HackerMode
âœ”Implement a lives system: when a snake dies, it loses a life. When all the lives are depleted, the game ends
âœ”On completing a sequence of blocks, the snake grows in size
âœ”If the snake eats itself, the game ends
âœ”As time progresses, make the snake move faster
âœ”Implement power-ups that spawn randomly and gain buffs on eating them, such as shrinking the snake and slowing it down
âœ”Implement a pause button.
âœ”Implement sound on snake-eating word
âœ”Implement variable grid size as per player request
